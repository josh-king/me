                <h1>Revision Revised? <small>21/10/2014 Tags; <a href="">revision</a>, <a href="">minecraft</a></small></h1>

                <p>A while a ago I created a modified <a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> client that became very popular very quickly.
                However as time went on, the time I could spend on developing the client decreased because of personal reasons. However at the moment
                I have some spare time to update the client, so expect an update within a couple of weeks. Once it is done I'll add a page on this
                website and transferring over all of the old buyers of the older rendition of the client.<br>

                <h1>Donations <small>13/10/2014 Tags; <a href="">japan</a>, <a href="">donation</a></small></h1>

                <p>I didn't really want to but I've created a <a href=
                "https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JHEFQ4VYGCHUU">donation link</a> that will send you to my page on paypal.
                I'm hoping that I'm going to be able to fund the entire trip by myself, however even though I am working as much as I can, this is going to be
                a <strong>big</strong> trip. Therefore if you have any small amount of change that you don't need, please feel free to send it to me. I feel
                like such a begger with this but it has to be done. Later on I may make some rewards for the people that do donate; however this is only
                temporary.<br></p>

        		<h1>Trip to Japan <small>13/10/2014 Tags; <a href="">japan</a>, <a href="">trip</a></small></h1>

		        <p>As most people don't know I'm going to be travelling to Japan at the end of this college year, although it will only be temporary I do really want
		        to make it a long time. I will be going with one of my friends from school and we will be living off the small amouint of money that we will have left
		        after we have paid for the accomidation. There's <em>no particular reason</em> that we chose to go to Japan, it just happened to look like a great
		        place to stay and vist.<br>
		        There's a lot of factors that will have to come into play for this to actually work. The main one being that I can actually fund the trip. At the
		        moment I am working a lot of hours for work, however budgeting is incredibly difficult because who knows what'll happen by the time the trip comes
		        around.<br>
		        Nevertheless I'm incredibly excited to go there, it looks like an amazing place to spend time at.</p>

                <h1>Tokyo Ghoul <small>13/10/2014 Tags; <a href="">anime</a>, <a href="">tokyo ghoul</a>, <a href="">thoughts</a></small></h1>

                <p>Welp, Tokyo ghoul ended recently <small>(well actually like a month ago now, but who's counting?)</small>. That's pretty much it, the anime
                was great; the animation, the soundtrack and the voice actors were amazing. Studio Pierrot did a great job with animating all of the battle
                sequences (how few there were), everything was so fluent and moved briliantly.<br>
                The only disapointment about this anime is the length. From the start I saw on MAL that it said 24 episodes so obviously I was excited <em>(a
                well done deadman wonderland and double the amount of episides?, oh shit)</em> but then halfway through the season, MAL updated the page to
                show that there was infact only 12 episodes. I thought this was a <a href="http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=652743">mistake</a> mainly
                because of how spaced out all of the episodes were; everything was being explained at slow pace with a couple of filler episodes, but no.<br>

                So yeah bascially fuck you Pierrot for making a great anime end just as soon as something amazing was about to happen. <strong>One Eyed
                Owl</strong>.</p>
