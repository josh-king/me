My website
==

This is my personal website. Check it out at my <strong>FREE</strong> domain; <a href="joshking.tk">joshking.tk</a><br>
<hr>

I will be showing a couple of neat concepts for html, but also my blog exists there! So read about stuff you probably don't care about!<br>

There is probably a couple of open sourced projects being used, and I will most likely have a small annotation giving credit to everything that gets used, however sometimes I may forget and if that happens then please remind me by email which is on the site. <br>
Thanks,<br>
Josh.
